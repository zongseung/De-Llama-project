It also includes the year-on-year growth rates in percentages.\n\n### Maximum Demand (최대부하)\n- **2020.4월**: 66,699 MW, with a decrease of 8.6% from the previous year.\n- **2021.4월**: 68,966 MW, showing an increase of 3.4%.\n- **2022.4월**: 71,881 MW, with a growth of 4.2%.\n- **2023.4월**: 72,292 MW, a slight increase of 0.6%.\n- **2024.4월**: Forecasted at 73,800 MW, with a growth rate of 2.1%.\n\n### Average Demand (평균부하)\n- **2020.4월**: 56,289 MW, with a decrease of 6.3%.\n- **2021.4월**: 58,030 MW, showing an increase of 3.1%.\n- **2022.4월**: 59,380 MW, with a growth of 2.3%.\n- **2023.4월**: 58,324 MW, a decrease of 1.8%.\n- **2024.4월**: Forecasted at 59,900 MW, with a growth rate of 2.7%.\n\n### Trends\n- Both maximum and average demand show a general upward trend from 2020 to 2024, despite some fluctuations.\n- The maximum demand consistently increases each year, with the highest growth in 2022.\n- The average demand also generally increases, except for a slight dip in 2023.\n- The forecast for 2024 indicates continued growth in both maximum and average demand.",
