    "summary": "The image appears to be a scale or gauge with two sections, labeled in Korean. \n\n- The left side is labeled \"이상저온\" (abnormally low temperature) and is colored blue. It indicates a range with a value of 10, suggesting temperatures below a certain threshold, specifically \"최저·최고기온 10퍼센타일 미만\" (below the 10th percentile of minimum and maximum temperatures).\n\n- The right side is labeled \"이상고온\" (abnormally high temperature) and is colored red. It indicates a range with a value of 90, suggesting temperatures above a certain threshold, specifically \"최저·최고기온 90퍼센타일 초과\" (above the 90th percentile of minimum and maximum temperatures).\n\nThis scale likely represents a measure of temperature anomalies, with the blue side indicating cooler than normal conditions and the red side indicating warmer than normal conditions. The context suggests this is part of an electricity demand forecast, where temperature extremes can significantly impact energy consumption."
